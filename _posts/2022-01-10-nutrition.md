It is said: &ldquo;Do not present secondary reasons to choose a diet as though they were the primary ones.&rdquo; <https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bujD9zhcb9Apii5J2/dietary-debates-among-the-fruit-gnomes>

So what&rsquo;s my primary reason for believing in Paleo?

It&rsquo;s not that I like the taste of meat and can&rsquo;t bear to let go. Back in 2013 when I decided to lose weight, I was ready to go all vegan or even eat nothing but broccoli if that&rsquo;s what it took. So I read up on necessary nutrients, all the vitamins, minerals and their different forms, to make sure I got enough.

If anything, I&rsquo;m biased in favour of bread and beer, because I like the stuff so much. I also like many vegetarian foods. I enjoy tofu, tempeh, seitan. I genuinely think quorn nuggets beat chicken nuggets. I enjoy legumes. And I don&rsquo;t want to be an iconoclast, not in terms of diet. I&rsquo;d much rather mesh easily with other people&rsquo;s diets for social reasons.

I read about retinoids (animal-sourced vitamin A) versus carotenoids (vegetable-sourced vitamin A). How to find vitamin K1 and K2 in a vegan diet. What role omega 3 plays, how much we need, and what factors might affect how much we need. Anyway I spent much of my free time that year just geeking out about nutrition, and was at the peak of my health. I virtually couldn&rsquo;t sunburn, I went shirtless and barefoot all the time, my immune system was king, my eyesight improved, my reflexes improved.

I should admit though, back then I did want to be an iconoclast, to hold the secret that society at large doesn&rsquo;t know. Now I use the experience of &ldquo;knowing the secret of keto&rdquo; as a reference point for what it must be like to be in a cult, and it&rsquo;s super useful. I must have been inundated enough with the traditional values of skepticism, because keto is what birthed my interest in statistics, so I could read the darn papers everyone was citing and make sense of them for myself (which I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to).  Now my outlook on optimal nutrition is slightly different and more flexible, and I think that biochemistry is so complicated that a reductionist approach focusing on specific nutrients doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this stage of the science. If you optimize for specific nutrients you&rsquo;re just [Goodharting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) it &#x2013; targeting the measure and not the underlying problem. In Kuhnian terms, the field of nutrition is still in a [pre-science](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Kuhn-Paradigm.html) stage. At this point I&rsquo;d only expect a holistic perspective to provide good answers, provided of course that you keep your pet holistic theory falsifiable and are in a position to learn from predictive failure (swap out the holistic framework for a different one when surprising evidence turns up). Be like astronomy, not astrology; be specific in your predictions, don&rsquo;t move the goalposts, be quick to abandon hypotheses, and don&rsquo;t bother to maintain unfalsifiable claims if you can&rsquo;t causally tie them to a related falsifiable claim.

# Beliefs as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2021-04-16 Fri]</span></span>

Okay, I want to be critiqued (by myself and others) on my nutrition world-view, so here&rsquo;s a bunch of claims I currently believe. I tried to make them concrete, if not falsifiable. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look back on this first version and feel super embarrassed at some point, but that&rsquo;s a good thing.

Nutrition-related assertions I&rsquo;m fairly confident of (let&rsquo;s call them beliefs)

-   It&rsquo;s hard to get nutrient overload from meat (barring a long period of only muscle meat)
-   Vitamin C deficiency can only occur if you have significant carb sources
-   Vitamin K2 deficiency makes teeth transparent & brittle
-   Bone broth can elevate plasma D3 (vitamin D level in blood) despite not containing D3 itself
-   Vitamin D supplementation generally helps short-term (but should not be sustained)
-   Vitamin D supplementation is harmful if hanging out in the sun would *not* increase it (something else the bottleneck)
-   The immune system works better in a fasted state
-   Staying in a ketotic metabolism for 300+ days a year will lengthen an average young adult&rsquo;s lifespan by 5-20 years and healthspan more than proportionately
-   When giving an OGTT to a ketotic person causes a hyperinsulinemic response (like a diabetic), it does not indicate a chronic problem: letting them acclimate to carbs for a day first will ensure a normal response to OGTT.
    -   Clarification: The above is true for non-diabetics. Also, a ketogenic diet will never cause diabetes.
-   A large portion (5-50%) of the Nordic population cannot meet their omega-3 need just with off-the-shelf omega-3 capsules, without resorting to such quantities that cause obvious adverse reactions due to other things in these capsules.
-   Fasting and IF lower the &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
-   Who does not eat liver should eat plenty of beans
-   Sugar raises your &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
-   Calorie-free sweeteners have a similar result on body weight in the long run as the quantity of sugar that corresponds to the same experience of sweetness. Colloquially speaking, replacing soda with light soda does nothing.
-   The level of glucose and ketones in the blood do not indicate the rate at which each is being burned, you need more information to figure this out.
    -   In other words, it is possible to have 5.5 mmol/l glucose (approx 27.5 mmol for whole body) but have those be the same 27.5 mmol in the evening as in the morning i.e. the body cells did not suck any of it up.
-   A meal needs to include ~3g of leucine to stimulate a cycle of muscle protein synthesis.
-   Vitamins taken in isolation have a different effect from vitamins in food.
-   Ingesting forty (40) large or eighty (80) small fish oil capsules in a day will either cause some kind of toxicity or nutrient imbalance, or simply be malabsorbed, and you may suffer discomfort, but the corresponding quantity of oily fish (300g) have none of these issues.
    -   This begs the question of how much omega-3 you need. This is individual. Inuit and some Nordic people need a lot(citation?). Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re in this Nordic subset. As some Inuit groups consumed 14-20g of omega-3 a day, let&rsquo;s say we need half of this, 7-10g a day, which means 200-300g herring/mackerel or over 30 large capsules &#x2013; per day!
    -   My takeaway is that for supplementing omega-3, fish oil compared to oily fish is like the night stars compared to the midday sun: the former isn&rsquo;t a realistic choice.
        -   For fun, extra problems surrounding fish oil is how it was extracted and purified, how you know it hasn&rsquo;t gone rancid or changed in the process, how you know there isn&rsquo;t also a concentration of heavy metals. Esuring these factors are taken care of will cost you a pretty penny, enough to pay for your whole paleo diet. Finally, there&rsquo;s more sn-2 DHA (which the body uses best) in seafood than in fish oil.
-   When a specific nutrient is discovered that we (1) need a relative lot of and (2) is found in few sources, this is evidence that we ought to eat a lot of this source, *period* &#x2013; for more reasons than this nutrient in particular!
    -   This is just &ldquo;Making Holism and Reductionism Cooperate 101&rdquo;.
-   Carotenoids (Vitamin A from plants) are nearly unabsorbed by >10% of the population, and are poorly absorbed by >50%.
-   A prerequisite for carotenoid absorption is that the meal contains fat.
-   Retinoids (Vitamin A from animals) are well absorbed by >95% of the population.
-   Fat-soluble vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, are stored longterm in fatty tissue, and the storage can last for months of fasting (as long as the fat stores do), provided the diet was consistently nutritious before.
    -   If the diet was not consistently nutritious before beginning fasting, the body fat liberated during fasting will be proportionately deficient in fat-solubles (50% confident).
-   (75% confidence) If you got plenty of sun during the summer, vitamin D levels stay high through winter, at least in the context of what&rsquo;s colloquially called a &ldquo;Paleo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keto&rdquo; diet.
-   Sugar ???
-   Grains ???
-   Cooking methods ???
-   The broth resulting from cooking ???

Terminology

-   &ldquo;Ketotic person&rdquo; &#x2013; someone (1) used to a ketogenic diet and (2) is in a state such that >50% of brain glucose use has been replaced by ketone use
    -   probably met after eating ketogenic for 3+ weeks and then making exceptions maximum once a week
-   &ldquo;In practice&rdquo; &#x2013; life is not a lab, soda and light soda may have different effects in the lab where other factors are held fixed, but when an individual makes the substitution in everyday life, this has knock-on effects that should count among the real effects of making the substitution. Light soda may itself be unable to cause weight gain, being calorie-free, but can still be rightly blamed for causing weight gain in practice: it happens thru knock-on effects. Put another way, whether it happens thru the mechanics of glucose intake (included with the food) and lipogenesis, or thru a less direct chain of effects that ends in glucose intake (from a different source), has the rational target for blame really changed? &ldquo;In practice&rdquo; is what matters.

# Questions I have

-   Which vitamins and minerals can be safely &ldquo;spammed&rdquo;?
    -   like C, B12, &#x2026; that seem to have no practical upper limit
    -   also check if consuming large quantities of these has effects on other vitamin needs
-   How well-connected is fasting to the immune system (and to disease recovery in general)?
    -   must depend on the disease - lupus, encephalitis, broken bone&#x2026;
-   What evidence for the GKI<1 strategy
-   What is knowable about fasting?
    -   <https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2014/12/30/can-a-3-day-fast-reset-your-immune-system/>
    -   see studies cited by jason fung
        -   try to counter selection bias by also looking for a prominent anti-fasting guru and check their studies

# Holism perspectives, version 1

-   Claiming that a diet would have fit into our Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA) is isometric to claiming that it&rsquo;s healthy &#x2013; that is to say, they are the same claim.
    -   Can this even be disagreed with? I&rsquo;d like to hear how, because this guides much of my thinking.
    -   In the above, the scope of &ldquo;diet&rdquo; is longer than a few weeks. In the short term, certainly something can be not-healthy for an individual because they&rsquo;re sick e.g.
    -   But pet cats live longer than wild cats
        -   Good observation! Do they actually age slower or just get killed less, impacting the average? How does the body of a 15-year old wild cat compared to a 15-year old pet cat?
        -   If wild life (life in EEA) has a negative effect on health, it seems to me unlikely to be due to diet, but rather stress/starvation/disease/cold.
            -   Sitting Bull, a &ldquo;wild human&rdquo;, was famous for being over 90 with good mental and physical health.
-   Let&rsquo;s taboo the word &ldquo;fat&rdquo;.
    -   The word makes you stupid. Say &ldquo;eating triglycerides makes you overweight&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;eating fat makes you fat&rdquo;.
        -   Why&rsquo;s it stupid? Compare &ldquo;Eating vegetables makes you green&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating duck turns you into a duck&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating sweets turns your body sweet&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating cholesterol increases blood cholesterol&rdquo;. I could go on and on. Some of these people actually say, others are clearly absurd, but they&rsquo;re all making the exact same type of error.
-   Let&rsquo;s be aware of hormesis and homeostasis. That the body reacts dynamically to input, so you cannot make a general conclusion from the effect of a certain quantity of one input, you need to test different quantities, and take into account how often the body has been exposed to this input in the past.
-   Your needs for a given nutrient change depending on how much you have of other nutrients.
    -   One way to boost a nutrient without starting to eat more of it is to reduce the rate of its depletion.
        -   Example: Vitamin C depleted by oxidation. One source of oxidation is carbs. Hence, carbs increase need for vitamin C.
        -   Example: Vitamin A and D seem to &ldquo;take out&rdquo; each other.
    -   Example: Vitamin D levels can stay fixed regardless of time in the sun until you fix a deficiency of one of the bone-health minerals, whereupon vitamin D is free to increase. This is a talking point in the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t supplement&rdquo; camp: possibly the body refuses to generate vit D to protect bone because it would trigger processes that it doesn&rsquo;t have the minerals to support, resulting in osteoporosis. Indeed, D supplementation has been connected to osteoporosis in some cases.
-   Let&rsquo;s not be content with Goodharting.
    -   A strong form of this position is that e.g. omega-3 supplements are just Goodharting a measure, the underlying cause of which is that we need seafood (no other realistic source), a need which cannot be met by eating any quantity of omega-3. You take the apparent need of specific nutrients as indication that we need those foods that contain them. This is due to the problem of unknown unknowns: how much of nutrition has been explored? 5%? Absent so much information, the precious few indicators we do get cannot be the full story, and are best used to guide our food selections.
-   Let&rsquo;s not quibble over what it means to need. &ldquo;Need&rdquo; is a funny concept. You don&rsquo;t need to eat seafood. You don&rsquo;t need an appendix or legs, either. Let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s shorthand for that it&rsquo;ll lengthen our lifespan.
