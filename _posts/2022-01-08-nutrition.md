# Self-intro

For honesty and transparency, I&rsquo;ll try to show who I am before starting a discussion.

It is said: &ldquo;[do not present secondary reasons to choose a diet as though they were the primary ones](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bujD9zhcb9Apii5J2/dietary-debates-among-the-fruit-gnomes)&rdquo;. So what&rsquo;s my primary reason for agreeing with the broad strokes of Paleo/Keto?

## Past me (2013)

It&rsquo;s not that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to let go of the taste of meat.  Back in 2013 when I decided to lose weight, I wasn&rsquo;t particularly a fan of meat.  I was ready to go animal-free or even eat nothing but broccoli for a year if that&rsquo;s what it took.  So I read up on necessary nutrients, all the vitamins, minerals and their different forms, to make sure I got enough.

I&rsquo;m biased in favour of bread and beer, because I like the stuff so much.  I also like many vegetarian foods.  I enjoy tofu, tempeh, seitan and legumes.  I think quorn nuggets beat chicken nuggets.

I read about retinoids (animal-sourced vitamin A) versus carotenoids (vegetable-sourced vitamin A).  How to find vitamin K1 and K2 in an animal-free diet.  What role omega 3 plays, how much we need, and what factors might affect how much we need.  Anyway I spent much of my free time that year just geeking out about nutrition, and was at the peak of my health.  I virtually couldn&rsquo;t sunburn, I went shirtless and barefoot all the time, my immune system was king, my eyesight improved, my reflexes improved.

I should admit that back then I wanted to be an iconoclast, to hold the secret that society at large doesn&rsquo;t know.  Now I use the experience of &ldquo;knowing the secret of keto&rdquo; as a reference point for what it must be like to be in a cult, and it&rsquo;s useful.  I must have been inundated enough with the traditional values of skepticism, because keto is what birthed my interest in statistics, so I could read the papers everyone was citing and make sense of them for myself (which I still haven&rsquo;t gotten around to).


<a id="org502d0bc"></a>

## Current me (2022)

Now I don&rsquo;t want to be an iconoclast in nutrition science.  I&rsquo;d rather my diet mesh easily with other people&rsquo;s diets for social reasons.

My outlook on optimal nutrition is slightly different from 2013-me and more flexible, and I think that biochemistry is so complicated that a reductionist approach focusing on specific nutrients doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this stage of the science.

If you optimize a diet for specific nutrients, I think you&rsquo;re just [Goodharting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) it: targeting a measure and not its underlying cause.  In Kuhnian terms, the field of nutrition is still in a [pre-science](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Kuhn-Paradigm.html) stage as far as I can tell.  At this point I&rsquo;d only expect a holistic perspective to provide good answers, provided of course that you keep your pet holistic theory falsifiable and are in a position to learn from predictive failure.  That is, you&rsquo;ll swap out the holistic framework you&rsquo;re using for a different one when surprising evidence turns up, rather than explain away the evidence so you can keep the framework unmodified.  Any evidence should result in *some* modification to your framework.  Be like astronomy, not like astrology; be specific in your predictions, don&rsquo;t move the goalposts, be quick to abandon hypotheses, and don&rsquo;t maintain claims that you can&rsquo;t causally tie to a related falsifiable claim.

# Beliefs as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-11 Tue]</span></span>

Okay, I want to be critiqued (by myself and others) on my nutrition world-view, so here&rsquo;s a bunch of claims I currently believe, in no particular order. I tried to make them concrete. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look back on this first version and be embarrassed at some point, but that&rsquo;s a good thing.

Nutrition-related assertions I&rsquo;m fairly confident of (let&rsquo;s call them beliefs)

-   It&rsquo;s hard to get nutrient overload from meat (barring a long period of eating only muscle meat)
-   Vitamin C deficiency can only occur if you have significant carb sources
-   Vitamin K2 deficiency makes teeth transparent & brittle
-   Including bone broth in diet can elevate vitamin D levels despite not containing D itself
-   Vitamin D supplementation generally helps short-term (but should not be sustained)
-   Vitamin D supplementation is harmful if hanging out in the sun would *not* increase it (something else the bottleneck)
    -   Clarification: suppose you take a person with low D levels, tell them to go out in the sun for two hours a day, and test them a few weeks later. Many people will show a much higher level of vit D, but some people will not have shown any increase. For these people, it&rsquo;s a bad idea to force it up with supplements, as there&rsquo;s a reason the body chose not to produce D.
-   The immune system works better in a fasted state
-   Staying in a ketotic metabolism for 300+ days a year will lengthen an average young adult&rsquo;s lifespan by 5-20 years and healthspan more than proportionately
-   When giving an OGTT to a ketotic person causes a hyperinsulinemic response (i.e. they react like a diabetic), it does not indicate a chronic problem: letting them acclimate to carbs for a day first will ensure a normal response to OGTT.
    -   Specification: The above is true for patients that do not already have diabetes. Related belief: a ketogenic diet will never cause diabetes.
-   A large portion (5-50%) of the Nordic population cannot meet their omega-3 need just with off-the-shelf omega-3 capsules, without resorting to such quantities that cause obvious adverse reactions due to other things in these capsules.
-   Fasting and IF lower the &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
-   Who does not eat liver should eat plenty of beans
-   Sugar raises your &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
-   Calorie-free sweeteners have a similar result on body weight in the long run as the quantity of sugar that corresponds to the same experience of sweetness. Colloquially speaking, replacing soda with light soda does nothing.
-   The level of glucose and ketones in the blood do not indicate the rate at which each is being burned, you need more information to figure this out.
    -   In other words, it is possible to have 5.5 mmol/l glucose (approx 27.5 mmol for whole body) but have those be the same 27.5 mmol in the evening as in the morning i.e. the body cells did not suck any of it up.
-   A meal needs to include ~3g of leucine to stimulate a cycle of muscle protein synthesis.
-   Vitamins taken in isolation have a different effect from vitamins in food.
-   Ingesting forty (40) large or eighty (80) small fish oil capsules in a day will either cause some kind of toxicity or nutrient imbalance, or simply be malabsorbed, and you may suffer discomfort, but the corresponding quantity of oily fish (300g) have none of these issues.
    -   This begs the question of how much omega-3 you need. This is individual. Inuit and some Nordic people need a lot(citation?). Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re in this Nordic subset. As some Inuit groups consumed 14-20g of omega-3 a day, let&rsquo;s say we need half of this, 7-10g a day, which means 200-300g herring/mackerel or over 30 large capsules &#x2013; per day!
    -   My takeaway is that for supplementing omega-3, fish oil compared to oily fish is like the night stars compared to the midday sun: the former isn&rsquo;t a realistic choice.
        -   For fun, extra problems surrounding fish oil is how it was extracted and purified, how you know it hasn&rsquo;t gone rancid or changed in the process, how you know there isn&rsquo;t also a concentration of heavy metals. Esuring these factors are taken care of will cost you a pretty penny, enough to pay for your whole paleo diet. Finally, there&rsquo;s more sn-2 DHA (which the body uses best) in seafood than in fish oil.
-   When a specific nutrient is discovered that we (1) need a relative lot of and (2) is found in few sources, this is evidence that we ought to eat a lot of this source, *period* &#x2013; for more reasons than this nutrient in particular!
    -   This is just &ldquo;Making Holism and Reductionism Cooperate 101&rdquo;.
-   Carotenoids (Vitamin A from plants) are nearly unabsorbed by >10% of the population, and are poorly absorbed by >50%.
-   A prerequisite for carotenoid absorption is that the meal contains fat.
-   Retinoids (Vitamin A from animals) are well absorbed by >95% of the population.
-   Fat-soluble vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, are stored longterm in fatty tissue, and the storage can last for months of fasting (as long as the fat stores do), provided the diet was consistently nutritious before.
    -   If the diet was not consistently nutritious before beginning fasting, the body fat liberated during fasting will be proportionately deficient in fat-solubles (50% confident).
-   (75% confidence) If you got plenty of sun during the summer, vitamin D levels stay high through winter, at least in the context of what&rsquo;s colloquially called a &ldquo;Paleo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keto&rdquo; diet.
-   (95% confidence) Coffee is about 99% as hydrating as water i.e. a liter of coffee is nearly indistinguishable from a liter of water for the body&rsquo;s hydration needs.
    -   A minor issue, but the fact there is a lot of disagreement on this point reveals how much confusion there is in nutrition science around even basic reasoning about human biochemistry.
-   For a majority of the population, exhorting &ldquo;eat less calories to lose weight&rdquo; either has no effect or causes weight *gain*, not loss.
-   Sugar ???
-   Grains ???
-   Cooking methods ???
-   The broth resulting from cooking ???
-   Gut health ???

Terminology

-   &ldquo;Ketotic person&rdquo; &#x2013; someone (1) used to a ketogenic diet and (2) is in a state such that >50% of brain glucose use has been replaced by ketone use
    -   probably met after eating ketogenic for 3+ weeks and then making exceptions a maximum of once a week

# Questions I have

-   Which vitamins and minerals can be safely &ldquo;spammed&rdquo;?
    -   like C, B12, &#x2026; that seem to have no practical upper limit
    -   also check if consuming large quantities of these has effects on other vitamin needs
-   How well-connected is fasting to the immune system (and to disease recovery in general)?
    -   must depend on the disease - lupus, encephalitis, broken bone&#x2026;
-   What evidence for the GKI<1 strategy
-   What is knowable about fasting?
    -   <https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2014/12/30/can-a-3-day-fast-reset-your-immune-system/>
    -   see studies cited by jason fung
        -   try to counter selection bias by also looking for a prominent anti-fasting guru and check their studies

# Holism perspectives to apply

-   Claiming that a diet would have fit into our Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA) is isometric to claiming that it&rsquo;s healthy &#x2013; that is to say, they are the same claim written with different synonyms.
    -   This guides much of my thinking, so can it be disagreed with?  CMV please.
    -   In the above claim, the scope of &ldquo;diet&rdquo; is longer than a few weeks. It speaks of the general trend of a person&rsquo;s diet. In the short term, something that normally fits in can be not-healthy (causing a reduction of lifespan) for an individual e.g. because they&rsquo;re sick and shouldn&rsquo;t be eating at all, or because they&rsquo;ve already eaten three days&rsquo; worth of calories that day.
    -   But pet cats live longer than wild cats
        -   Good observation! Do they actually age slower or just get killed less, impacting the average? How does the body of a 15-year old wild cat compared to a 15-year old pet cat?
        -   If wild life (life in EEA) has a negative effect on health, it seems to me unlikely to be due to diet, but rather stress/starvation/disease/cold.
            -   Sitting Bull, a &ldquo;wild human&rdquo;, was famous for being over 90 with good mental and physical health.
-   Let&rsquo;s taboo the word &ldquo;fat&rdquo;, because it has dual meanings: a noun meaning triglycerides (lipid molecules), and an adjective meaning being overweight.
    -   Say &ldquo;eating triglycerides makes you overweight&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;eating fat makes you fat&rdquo;.
        -   Compare &ldquo;Eating vegetables makes you green&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating duck turns you into a duck&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating sweets turns your body sweet&rdquo;. &ldquo;Eating cholesterol increases blood cholesterol&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re all the same type of error, we easily take a cognitive shortcut when hearing this kind of statement.
-   Let&rsquo;s take into account hormesis and homeostasis. That the body reacts dynamically to input, so you cannot make a general conclusion from the effect of a certain quantity of one input, you need to test different quantities, and take into account how often the body has been exposed to this input in the past.
-   Your needs for a given nutrient change depending on how much you have of other nutrients.
    -   One way to boost a nutrient without starting to eat more of it is to reduce the rate of its depletion.
        -   Example: Vitamin C depleted by oxidation. One source of oxidation is carb metabolism. Hence, carbs increase need for vitamin C.
        -   Example: Vitamin A and D seem to &ldquo;take out&rdquo; each other.
    -   Example: Vitamin D levels can stay fixed regardless of time in the sun until you fix a deficiency of one of the bone-health minerals (calcium, boron, &#x2026;), whereupon vitamin D is free to increase. This is a talking point in the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t supplement&rdquo; camp: possibly the body refuses to generate vit D to protect bone because it would trigger processes that it doesn&rsquo;t have the minerals to support. Indeed, D supplementation has been connected to osteoporosis in some cases.
-   Let&rsquo;s not be content with Goodharting, i.e. trying to maximize all nutrients we have previously seen correlate with health, and calling it done.
    -   A strong form of this position is that e.g. omega-3 supplements are just Goodharting a measure, the underlying cause of which is that we need seafood, a need which cannot be met by eating any quantity of omega-3&#x2026; because omega-3 is only omega-3, and contains nothing else that&rsquo;s typical of seafood! You take the apparent need of specific nutrients as indication that we need those foods that contain them. This is due to the problem of unknown unknowns: how much of nutrition has been explored? 5%? Absent so much information, the precious few indicators we do get cannot be the full story, and are best used to guide our food selections.
-   What does &ldquo;needing&rdquo; a nutrient mean? &ldquo;Need&rdquo; is a funny concept. You don&rsquo;t need to eat seafood. You don&rsquo;t need an appendix or legs, either. And you don&rsquo;t need friends or love in your life. Let&rsquo;s just call it a shorthand for that it&rsquo;ll lengthen our lifespan.
-   Practical reality is the whole reality.  Let&rsquo;s use the words &ldquo;in practice&rdquo; as often as we can.  It reminds us that **life is not a lab**; soda and light soda may have different effects on a lab patient where other factors are held fixed, but when an individual makes a substitution of soda for light soda in everyday life, this has knock-on effects that should count among the real, practical effects of making the substitution.  Light soda may itself be unable to cause weight gain, being calorie-free, but can still be rightly blamed or causing weight gain in practice: it just happens thru knock-on effects.  Put another way, whether it happens thru the mechanics of glucose intake (calories included with the food) and the concomitant lipogenesis, or thru a less direct chain of effects that ends up in glucose intake (from a different source), has the rational target for blame really changed?  &ldquo;In practice&rdquo; is what matters in the end.
