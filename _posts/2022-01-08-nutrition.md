# Self-intro

For transparency, I&rsquo;ll try to show who I am before starting a discussion.  I&rsquo;m a 30-year old Swedish male, grown up in Sweden.  I do not study biochemistry, nutrition, dietetics, medicine, physiology or any other relevant field.  My fields of expertise are in computers and statistics.

What prompted me to write this post was hearing someone say &ldquo;[do not present secondary reasons to choose a diet as though they were the primary ones](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bujD9zhcb9Apii5J2/dietary-debates-among-the-fruit-gnomes)&rdquo;.  So what&rsquo;s my primary reason for agreeing with the broad strokes of Paleo/Keto, if I still do?  Let&rsquo;s find out.


<a id="org0941e76"></a>

## Past me (2013)

Many people are prone to assume that meat-eaters just can&rsquo;t bear to give up the taste.  Back in 2013 when I decided to lose weight, I liked meat but wasn&rsquo;t a fan in any particular way.  I was ready to go animal-free or even eat nothing but broccoli for a year if that&rsquo;s what it took.  So I read up on necessary nutrients, all the vitamins, minerals and their different forms, to make sure I got enough.

I had no bias for meat, but I was (and still am) biased in favour of bread and beer, because I like the stuff so much.  I also like many vegetarian foods.  I enjoy tofu, tempeh, seitan and legumes, and always loved salads.  I think quorn nuggets beat chicken nuggets.

I read about retinoids (animal-sourced vitamin A) versus carotenoids (vegetable-sourced vitamin A).  How to find vitamin K1 and K2 in an animal-free diet.  What role omega 3 plays, how much we need, and what factors might affect how much we need.  I read about formulating an ideal nutritional supp regimen on the Longecity forum.

Time and time again, I found that the nutrient under analysis can be found in some animal tissue or other, together with all the right cofactors that aid its absorption.  Often in the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; part from a cholesterol perspective, e.g. the egg yolk, the saturated animal fat, the reddest red meat.  Meat started looking like a preformulated nutritional supp from Nature.  So that&rsquo;s what I ate.  I spent much of my free time that year just geeking out about nutrition, and was at the peak of my health.  I virtually couldn&rsquo;t sunburn, I went shirtless and barefoot all the time, my immune system was king, my eyesight improved, my reflexes improved.

I should admit that back then I wanted to be an iconoclast, to hold the secret that society at large doesn&rsquo;t know.  Now I use the experience of &ldquo;knowing the secret of keto&rdquo; as a reference point for what it must be like to be in a cult, and it&rsquo;s useful.  I remained skeptical enough that keto birthed my interest in statistics, so I could read the papers everyone was citing and make sense of them for myself (which I still haven&rsquo;t gotten around to).


<a id="org3636f72"></a>

## Current me (2022)

These days I don&rsquo;t want to be an iconoclast in nutrition science.  I&rsquo;d rather my diet mesh easily with other people&rsquo;s diets for social reasons.

My outlook on optimal nutrition is slightly different from 2013-me and more flexible, and I think that biochemistry is so complicated that a reductionist approach focusing on specific nutrients doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this stage of the science.

If you optimize a diet for specific nutrients, I think you&rsquo;re just [Goodharting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) it: targeting a measure and not its underlying cause.  In Kuhnian terms, the field of nutrition doesn&rsquo;t appear to have gotten out of the [pre-science](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Kuhn-Paradigm.html) stage.  At this point I&rsquo;d only expect a holistic perspective to provide good answers, provided of course that you keep your pet holistic theory falsifiable and are in a position to learn from predictive failure.  That is, you&rsquo;ll swap out the holistic framework you&rsquo;re using for a different one when surprising evidence turns up, rather than explain away the evidence so you can keep the framework unmodified.  Any evidence should result in *some* modification to your framework.  Be like astronomy, not like astrology; be specific in your predictions, don&rsquo;t move the goalposts, be quick to abandon hypotheses, and don&rsquo;t maintain any unfalsifiable claims unless you can causally tie them to a different-but-related claim that is falsifiable.

# Beliefs

Updated <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-11 Tue]</span></span>

Okay, I want critique on my nutrition world-view, so here&rsquo;s a bunch of claims I currently believe, in no particular order. I tried to make them concrete.  Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll look back on this version and be embarrassed, but that&rsquo;s good.

1.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-05-08 Sun] </span></span> 10:1 for) The things the average animal of a given species ate over a lifetime in its EEA (Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness) reflects so accurately what&rsquo;s healthy for it, that you can treat these claims as synonymous: &ldquo;we ate like this in the past&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is healthy for us&rdquo;.
2.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-05-08 Sun] </span></span> 7:1 for) The human animal appears designed as a habitual carnivore and especially &rsquo;fativore&rsquo;.
    -   Specifically, my odds are 1:7 against that the human design indicates an EEA where it was common to consume plant carbs for a large share (>33%) of its lifetime calories.
3.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 2:1 for) Within 12 months, it&rsquo;s hard to get nutrient overload symptoms from eating only meat, provided the meat is fatty
4.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 3:1 for) Within 12 months, it&rsquo;s hard to get nutrient deficiency symptoms of eating only meat, provided the meat is fatty
5.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 3:1 for) Vitamin C deficiency can only occur if you have significant dietary carbs without dietary vitamin C (see [Vitamin C](#org328bdbf) section)
6.  (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 15:1 for) Vitamin K2 deficiency makes teeth transparent & brittle
7.  Including bone broth in diet can elevate vitamin D levels despite not containing D itself
8.  Vitamin D supplementation generally helps short-term (but should not be sustained)
9.  Vitamin D supplementation is harmful if hanging out in the sun would *not* increase it (something else the bottleneck)
    -   Clarification: suppose you take a person with low D levels, tell them to go out in the sun for two hours a day, and test them a few weeks later. Many people will show a much higher level of vit D, but some people will not have shown any increase. For these people, it&rsquo;s a bad idea to force it up with supplements, as there&rsquo;s a reason the body chose not to produce D, such as lack of magnesium or calcium.
10. The immune system works better in a fasted state
11. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 5:1 for) Staying in a ketotic metabolism for 300 days a year will lengthen an average young adult&rsquo;s lifespan by 5-20 years and healthspan more than proportionately
12. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-06-18 Sat] </span></span> 20:1 for) When giving an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to a ketotic person (i.e. feeding them 150g of sugar) causes a hyperinsulinemic response (i.e. they react like a diabetic), it does not indicate a chronic problem with this person: letting them acclimate to carbs for a day first will ensure a normal response to OGTT thereafter.
    -   Specification: The above is true for patients that do not already have diabetes.  Important related belief (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-29 Sat] </span></span> 7:1 for): a ketogenic diet will never cause the onset of diabetes.
13. A large portion (10-50%) of the Nordic population cannot meet their omega-3 need just with off-the-shelf omega-3 capsules, without resorting to such quantities that cause obvious adverse reactions due to other things in these capsules.
14. Fasting and IF lower the &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
15. Who does not eat liver is wise to eat plenty of beans (for folate)
16. Sugar raises your &ldquo;bodyweight set-point&rdquo;
17. Calorie-free sweeteners have a similar result on body weight in the long run as the quantity of sugar that corresponds to the same experience of sweetness. Colloquially speaking, replacing soda with light soda does nothing.
18. The level of glucose and ketones in the blood do not indicate the rate at which each is being burned, you need more information to figure this out.
    -   In other words, it is possible to have 5.5 mmol/l glucose (approx 27.5 mmol for whole body) but have those be the same 27.5 mmol in the evening as in the morning i.e. the body cells did not suck any of it up.
19. A meal needs to include ~3g of leucine to stimulate a cycle of muscle protein synthesis.
20. Vitamins taken in isolation have a different effect from vitamins in food.
21. Ingesting forty (40) large or eighty (80) small fish oil capsules in a day will either cause some kind of toxicity or nutrient imbalance, or simply be malabsorbed, and you may suffer discomfort, but the corresponding quantity of oily fish (300g) have none of these issues.
    -   This begs the question of how much omega-3 you need. This is individual. Inuit and some Nordic people need a lot(citation?). Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re in this Nordic subset. As some Inuit groups consumed 14-20g of omega-3 a day, let&rsquo;s say we need half of this, 7-10g a day, which means 200-300g herring/mackerel or over 30 large capsules &#x2013; per day!
    -   My takeaway is that for supplementing omega-3, fish oil compared to oily fish is like the night stars compared to the midday sun: the former isn&rsquo;t a realistic choice.
        -   For fun, extra problems surrounding fish oil is how it was extracted and purified, how you know it hasn&rsquo;t gone rancid or changed in the process, how you know there isn&rsquo;t also a concentration of heavy metals. Esuring these factors are taken care of will cost you a pretty penny, enough to pay for your whole paleo diet. Finally, there&rsquo;s more sn-2 DHA (which the body uses best) in seafood than in fish oil.
22. When a specific nutrient is discovered that we (1) need a relative lot of and (2) is found in few sources, this is evidence that we ought to eat a lot of this source, *period* &#x2013; for more reasons than this nutrient in particular!
    -   This is just &ldquo;Making Holism and Reductionism Cooperate 101&rdquo;.
23. Carotenoids (Vitamin A from plants) are nearly unabsorbed by >10% of the population, and are poorly absorbed by >50%.
24. A prerequisite for carotenoid absorption is that the meal contains fat.
25. Retinoids (Vitamin A from animals) are well absorbed by >95% of the population.
26. Fat-soluble vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, are stored longterm in fatty tissue, and the storage can last for months of fasting (as long as the fat stores do), provided the diet was consistently nutritious before.
    -   If the diet was not consistently nutritious before beginning fasting, the body fat liberated during fasting will be proportionately deficient in fat-solubles (50% confident).
27. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-29 Sat] </span></span> 3:1 for) If you got plenty of sun during the summer, vitamin D levels stay high through winter, at least in the context of what&rsquo;s colloquially called a &ldquo;Paleo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keto&rdquo; diet.
28. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-29 Sat] </span></span> 20:1 for) Coffee is about 99% as hydrating as water i.e. a liter of coffee is nearly indistinguishable from a liter of water for the body&rsquo;s hydration needs.
    -   A minor issue, but the fact there is a lot of disagreement on this point reveals how much confusion there is in nutrition science around even basic reasoning about human biochemistry. How then can I trust anyone?  How can the field proceed to start settling bigger, more interesting hypotheses?
        -   At least this becomes a litmus test: if a writer says coffee does not hydrate, they&rsquo;re a huckster who did no homework and you&rsquo;d best avoid their book.
29. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-29 Sat] </span></span> 3:1 for) For a majority of the population, exhorting &ldquo;eat less calories to lose weight&rdquo; either has no effect in practice or causes weight *gain*, not loss.
30. (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-01-29 Sat] </span></span> 1:1 for) Lack of sunlight is an epigenetic trigger for myopia.
31. After cooking meat or vegetables, some nutrients (at least electrolytes) leak into the cooking water, which should always be consumed.  This is one problem with processed meats such as ham, the cooking water has been removed.  For flour-based stuff such as pasta, this is not important.

Terminology

-   &ldquo;Ketotic person&rdquo; &#x2013; someone (1) used to a ketogenic diet and (2) is in a state such that >50% of brain glucose use has been replaced by ketone use
    -   assuredly met after eating ketogenic (averaging <20g carb/day) for 3+ weeks

## Cruxes for low-carb

Carrying out Internal Double Crux, I&rsquo;ve found my *cruxes*.  If I believed differently on these points, my nutrition outlook would change.

1.  The EEA argument, see Belief #1
2.  The human design argument, see Belief #2
3.  Ketones appear so great for health, how do we explain that if we&rsquo;re not meant to spend much time ketogenic?  Ergo we&rsquo;re meant to do so.
4.  High insulin load (total insulin released over a day) appears so bad for health, how do you explain that if low-fat high-carb is good?  Ergo we&rsquo;re not meant to do so often.
5.  Calories and protein from animal sources both appear better-adapted for humans than the same from plant sources
    -   (this seems the case for all animals, as even horses eat meat opportunistically, and it&rsquo;s logical that the building blocks of an animal would be good raw material for the body of an animal &#x2013; recognize the tautology?)


<a id="orgeb991b0"></a>

## Other cruxes

Beliefs orthogonal to (unaffected by) the whole hullabaloo of &ldquo;low-carb vs. low-fat&rdquo;.

1.  Seed oils are bad
    -   because not EEA (see belief 1)
    -   and because all clinically successful diets have excluded it
2.  Sugar bad
3.  &ldquo;Processed food&rdquo; frequently sub-par, depending on processing
4.  If an EEA culture had focused on forage over hunt, even for periods, calories would have been predominantly from root vegs, fruit, and the fat in insects such as worms, but not appreciably from nuts and not at all from seeds or grain.
    1.  The insect point is interesting because it wouldn&rsquo;t occur to many Western theorists.  Of course when foraging in the Horn of Africa, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;d skip over the insects you find along the way.  Cultures that left such free lunches on the table would get their numbers overtaken by cultures that did eat all thee food they found.
5.  Fiber is unnecessary
    -   [End the Fiber Fantasy](https://old.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lolqu/end_the_fiber_fantasy_everything_you_dont_want_to/), comments also enlightening
6.  Seafood is important for lifespan and healthspan
7.  In the long term, sweeteners act approximately as fattening as sugar

# Perspectives and thought experiments


<a id="orgb9090e8"></a>

## TODO Via negativa

The ancient Romans used the expression *via negativa* (the &ldquo;negative road&rdquo;), for viewing a problem through the opposite sort of lens from how you might first view it.  You may have heard Einstein&rsquo;s popular quote &ldquo;perfection is achieved not when there&rsquo;s nothing more to add, but when there&rsquo;s nothing left to take away&rdquo;, an example of *via negativa*.

For nutrition, consider the badness of pesticides, badness of insulin, badness of carbohydrate metabolism, and on and on&#x2026; even such things as the badness of tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cookware, the badness of barbecuing, and the badness of mixing sugar with protein in one meal.  Almost everything&rsquo;s bad in some way, so could health be more determined by what you avoid rather than what you include?

Concrete example: Vitamin D and bone broth. (&#x2026;)

-   ( [Sun: APVDS part 1: Problems With the Naked Ape Hypothesis](http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/an-ancestral-perspective-on-vitamin-d-status-part-1-problems-with-the-naked-ape-hypothesis-of-optimal-serum-25ohd/) )

<a id="org83c6aff"></a>

## &ldquo;Fat&rdquo; means either lipids or excess weight, not both

-   Everyone should taboo the word &ldquo;fat&rdquo; as often as possible, because it has dual meanings: a noun meaning triglycerides (lipid molecules), and an adjective meaning being overweight.  It short-circuits our logic sometimes.
    -   Say &ldquo;eating triglycerides makes you overweight&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;eating fat makes you fat&rdquo;.  The first form invites critique, asking for supporting evidence, while we may accept the second with nary a thought if we&rsquo;re not careful.
        -   Compare &ldquo;Eating vegetables makes you green&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Eating duck turns you into a duck&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Eating cholesterol increases blood cholesterol&rdquo;.  They&rsquo;re all the same type of error.


<a id="org7068f77"></a>

## 20 calories a day

The energy balance hypothesis has a common objection: the 20 calories a day thought experiment first written in 1941(?) and repopularized by Taubes in 2012.

Assume these things:

-   The energy balance hypothesis is true, i.e. controlling what you put on your plate is a reliable way to control your body weight
-   You&rsquo;re lean today
-   You want to still be lean 20 years from now

OK, now how precisely do you have to watch the calories on your plate?  How much extra will make you obese 20 years from now?  The answer is 20 calories a day.

Please see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDneyrETR2o&t=28m18s> (a couple of minutes starting at 28:18).

1.  First, 20 calories is a difference you cannot account for outside the lab.  It&rsquo;s near-impossible even to estimate your calorie intake and expenditure to within 200 calories of the correct answer, even if you measured the quantities of food you ate down to the gram, as the calorie density within any given food also varies, and your body varies in its expenditure, and this variation is unpredictable.
2.  Second, it seems an uncontroversial fact that the body&rsquo;s calorie expenditure **is influenced by the calorie intake**, so that lower intake means lower expenditure.  Given this moving target, you cannot ever know how much of an excess you are running.

Either of these injunctions suffice to kill this primitive form of the energy balance hypothesis.  You could object that it&rsquo;s not about watching on a daily basis, but a longer timescale: starting to restrict food once your belt is tight, eating more liberally once it doesn&rsquo;t, rinse and repeat.  I agree that makes more sense.  I wrote this section for three reasons:

-   Introduce the thought experiment, which was mind-blowing to me at the time and may be to you too
    -   If mind-blowing, it patches a gap in the connection between your ideas and reality
-   Point out it&rsquo;s not actually an argument against the energy balance hypothesis, and we need more to discredit it
-   The main purpose of the thought experiment: point out that calorie counting is cursed to be incredibly inexact, and therefore if anything you must adopt a reactive approach and it&rsquo;s a waste of time to micromanage daily calories

In other news, I doubt even a refined version of the energy balance hypothesis will make sense &#x2013; the rest of Gary Taubes&rsquo; video ([Why We Get Fat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDneyrETR2o)) is why.

## TODO The power of anecdata

Anecdata is rightly shunned for most purposes.  Even outside the ivory tower of science, followers of a given world-view are happy to disqualify &ldquo;the enemy camp&rsquo;s&rdquo; reasoning whenever it relies on anecdata.

Is it always meaningless, best ignored?  In fact no, and parts of reality will always elude us if we reject it.  It sometimes makes good evidence, so it pays to understand when it does and when it doesn&rsquo;t.

There&rsquo;s a class of hypotheses we can reject after seeing a *single* piece of evidence.  A schoolbook example is the belief &ldquo;all swans are white&rdquo;; when you see a single black swan, that should be enough to reject this belief.  You don&rsquo;t need to repeat this observation 100 times and obtain a statistically significant result&#x2026; at a sample size of one, it&rsquo;s already significant.  An anecdote, and yet also proof.

If you strongly believed in &ldquo;all swans are white&rdquo;, you might suspect somebody&rsquo;s covered this one swan in tar.  But after observing two or three black swans on separate occasions, you&rsquo;d still reject it.

If you hear somebody *else* say they observed a black swan, but you didn&rsquo;t observe it yourself, the story takes on a different character.  Like when someone says they saw a ghost or an UFO, there are a million different plausible explanations for why they thought they saw that or why they are saying that they saw that, all more plausible than the ghost.

In this situation, something that matters is *who* and *why*.

-   Who&rsquo;s telling you this data?
    -   Keywords: sampling frame (or sample size), observer selection, &#x2026;
    -   &ldquo;What is the sample size from which this information came?&rdquo;
-   Did you directly prompt for the data, or did they choose the topic and serve you the data without your imagining it existed?
    -   Keywords: counterfactuals, Texas sharpshooter, observer selection (again) &#x2026;

These factors make a massive influence on how much informative power that anecdata has for you.

---

Let me put on my statistician hat for a moment.  There are times when it&rsquo;s rational for you to regard anecdata as medium-strength evidence, and times when it&rsquo;s no evidence at all, because of something called *selection effects*.

If you hear something unbelievable on the Internet or in the news, it usually constitutes next to no support for any general conclusion, because we live on a planet of billions of humans, and freakish events happen to someone every day.  No matter how rare, these freakish events get promoted to our attention.

Here is a question of *sampling frame*&#x2026; if the frame is seven billion, and you look for data that supports a hypothesis, you will find it, you&rsquo;ll even find a group of hundreds of people for a &rsquo;statistically significant&rsquo; result (cherry picking) &#x2013; which is why it&rsquo;s so important that the researcher select subjects in a random and transparent way, maybe even outsource the job of selecting subjects to an impartial outside agency.  

By contrast, if your (pre-chosen) sampling frame is your immediate family, and you go quiz them about something **specific** (not &ldquo;did you ever see anything unbelievable?&rdquo;, but &ldquo;did you ever see someone hit by lightning?&rdquo;), it&rsquo;s not likely you turn up any interesting results &#x2026; but if you did, that would be real information.  If your family has 4 members apart from yourself, and one has seen someone hit by lightning, that&rsquo;s 1 out of 4.  Naively then, you could guess that you have a 1/4 chance in your own lifetime to see lightning hit someone, at least with no other information to go on.  In practice, you do have more information &#x2013; you suspect people would talk about getting hit by lightning a lot more if it was that common, so you&rsquo;d downgrade that 1/4 figure to something smaller, like 1/40.

But notice that the quiz did give you *some* information.  It&rsquo;s a lot more than if you just happened to hear about it on an internet forum, which is approximately no information at all, even though both sources come from one individual making one claim.  What makes the whole difference for you is the sampling frame &#x2013; how many *could* have given you the data if it happened to them &#x2013; and the fact you didn&rsquo;t directly prompt for the data, and the set of counterfactual worlds &#x2013; what *other* things all observers in your reference class could have heard instead of the lightning thing.  That is one of the core lessons of Science, that we incrementally learned through the centuries: you can make information much, much more trustworthy, just by asking for it in a principled way.  Information you merely stumble across can only generate a hypothesis, not confirm anything, and least of all generate *and* confirm in one go.  Most hypotheses will turn out to be a wild goose chase, because that&rsquo;s the nature of reality:  an ocean of wrong ideas and a handful of less wrong ideas that are useful (and one forever unknowable full truth).

If you had asked about anyuthing amazing happen, you&rsquo;d get 1/4 chance of seeing something amazing happen, but you couldn&rsquo;t conclude 1/4 chance of seeing lightning happen, because the question that prompted this data was not about lightning: that&rsquo;s a specific that you received unasked-for.  And you couldn&rsquo;t afterwards, knowing that they&rsquo;ve seen lightning, ask them specifically about lightning: that&rsquo;s HARK and why you need new data to confirm a pattern (asking for it) seen in an exploratory study (which gave you the pattern unasked-for).  You could extend your sampling frame to &ldquo;everyone inside this apartment building minus my family (because of HARK: start clean)&rdquo; and go to your neighbours and ask them about lightning; you&rsquo;d soon find that the rate isn&rsquo;t anywhere near 1/4.

Key concepts: Non-representative sample of typical cases, cherry picking, &#x2026;
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence>

But suppose you use someone else&rsquo;s exploratory study as your confirmatory study? Since you didn&rsquo;t know the results beforehand, and approach someone else&rsquo;s dataset with your own hypothesis, like &ldquo;red meat leads to cancer&rdquo;, could you confirm it? The answer is yes, conditional on your process of how you chose which study to look at.  You can only regard it as confirmation if the process didn&rsquo;t introduce bias.  If you were to just riffle through lots of studies until you find one that confirms your theory, this is just the same as cherry-picking data on another level: cherry-picking studies.  Sure, the subjects in study number 34 showed the pattern, but what about all the people in studies number 1 through 33?  What&rsquo;s more rational is to take into account *all* studies from 1 through 34 and see if the pattern still holds.  Even that is problematic since you stopped *right* when you found a study with the pattern &#x2013; what&rsquo;s even better is to have chosen ahead of time &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look at 50 studies&rdquo;, the exact number isn&rsquo;t important so long as you stick to it no matter whether you find a pattern or not.  Only by that ritual will your findings become real information to you.  You must be willing to accept that you were wrong.  Science doesn&rsquo;t work without that willingness; one who lacks it is not doing science, even though they may be reading papers and doing all the externally visible parts of what looks like science.  For a process to become scientific, it requires a pledge inside the researcher&rsquo;s mind, to tie herself to the mast of accepting whatever the data may say.

This is basically how a meta-analysis or systematic review works. Though they don&rsquo;t use a simplistic cutoff like &ldquo;50 studies&rdquo;, but a cutoff like &ldquo;all studies above a certain quality&rdquo;.  There will not be that many high-quality studies with directly comparable data suitable for answering a research question, which makes it easier.

You cannot use others&rsquo; erroneous reasoning as evidence that you are right.  Negated stupidity is not intelligence.  If there are a thousand possible answers and you disprove one, it does not mean that your favored answer is correct!  There are 998 other answers.

You don&rsquo;t need to dismantle others&rsquo; others reasoning when you are excellent at dismantling your own.  Say you accept someone else&rsquo;s reasoning and integrate it into your belief system.  Since it is now your own, you&rsquo;ll go ahead and look for flaws, and if necessary dismantle it just the same as with other false beliefs of yours.  Being able to dismantle your own reasoning *is* being able to dismantle those of others.  It comes with the territory, and you want to be able to criticize yourself precisely as well as you can criticize others &#x2013; a one-to-one ratio &#x2013; and so learning to battle others for the sake of it will only tip the scales against yourself finding truth.  *First learn to battle yourself*.

Modern rationality is taking on a responsibility to yourself.  Taking seriously the fact that you can mislead yourself.  If you *actually* want to win, and aren&rsquo;t merely out to *feel* like you&rsquo;re winning (I bet nine out of ten you fall into the latter category right now, especially if you vehemently claim you do not), you cannot be in it for the good feels.  You have a job to do &#x2013; perhaps you want to help the world, or cure a friend of disease that stumps doctors &#x2013; and your own comfortable feeling of having already found The Truth is an irrelevant casualty on the way to finishing the job.

## Doctor education

The curriculum for a medical doctor involves almost no nutrition schooling.  Harvard doctors get 2 hours of *total* of nutrition education.   (source?)  This means that like for the rest of us, much of what they know indirectly comes from news headlines.  When a doctor says &ldquo;mmhmm this looks bad, you need to eat less fat&rdquo; they are drawing on the same knowledge as your aunt or your brother-in-law.

-   Q: I&rsquo;ve heard that doctors frequently get seminars on nutrition, paid by the ADA (American Diabetics Association) and other fronts of big agra &#x2013; meaning the money trail leads back to such trustworthy entities as the Coca Cola Company.  Is this true?

I don&rsquo;t mean to be skeptical of experts.  It&rsquo;s just the reality that they&rsquo;re *not* experts.  Nor do I mean to be skeptical only of the mainstream, or of health care professionals.  You get no points for being &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;.  No matter their background, diet gurus of every stripe always seem to be peddling more than they can possibly know.  Everyone feels qualified to have an opinion.  Everyone feels it&rsquo;s *safe* to have an opinion, and this makes for a sea of Dunning-Kruger bullshit, a nightmare to navigate.

## Pre-science

Maybe I jump the gun, but at this time the field of nutrition science looks to me like what Thomas Kuhn describes as a *pre-science*.  The field is still in the crib, and lots of academics were quick to stake their reputation on early hypotheses and now risk their careers if they admit they&rsquo;re wrong.  That&rsquo;s how nowadays we get quite interesting reductionist findings and people reminding us of case studies left unexplained, but what the high-prestige names tend to tell us to do sound like they haven&rsquo;t integrated all the evidence, and we have to wait for them to die off before the evidence comes to use.

It&rsquo;s not science when academics go around looking for more reasons they&rsquo;re right rather than reasons they&rsquo;re wrong.  They&rsquo;re pretending to be scientists.  In mature fields like physics or math, researchers spend every day looking for reasons their theory is wrong, because they know that&rsquo;s the only way to learn anything that has a chance of being true.  It&rsquo;s like the saying that &ldquo;a good mathematician is wrong twenty times a day, so you must either be a masochist or a bad mathematician&rdquo;.  Scientists enjoy being wrong, and nutrition authorities&#x2026; don&rsquo;t seem to.  On that basis, we can expect to find very little truth in the current nutrition theories.

## TODO Goodhart&rsquo;s Law

In an article detailing how to stop being socially awkward, this was one of ten indicators of being socially awkward:

> 1.  Constantly replaying that embarrassing moment or awkward silence in your head.

Now suppose the awkward person stopped doing that. Are they less awkward now? Probably not.  This is one of the indicators the author chose of an underlying problem, and if you target the indicators, that&rsquo;s all you can expect to succeed at: removing the indicators.

In the same vein, targeting one of the indicators that many doctors use to diagnose an underlying disease, will only remove the indicator, not the disease. Cholesterol is high in certain people, but that does not mean that if one of those people reduce their cholesterol in some artificial way, they will become unlike who they have been until then. However if they then go to a doctor they will be praised, because what else is there to measure than indicators?

This is called targeting a symptom rather than the disease.  Keep track of the difference.  You don&rsquo;t want low cholesterol or some such, you want low risk of heart disease, of which cholesterol *can* be an indicator (unreliable).  Accordingly, a study that wants to measure risk of heart disease would ideally do it by checking how many of their subjects kick the bucket later on, not by measuring cholesterol, which could&rsquo;ve been affected by the study&rsquo;s intervention in a way that does not affect risk of heart disease.

## TODO Energy mobilization

I find it unnerving how many people bikeshed about nutrition without knowing how the body fuels itself throughout the day or what the energy is mainly used for.  I will quickly explain my understanding of it.  I&rsquo;m sadly no biochemist so please correct any errors.


<a id="org65e8430"></a>

### Part One: Fasted

Let&rsquo;s start with a simple case: your stomach is empty and you haven&rsquo;t eaten for a week.  Now you lift your arm.

What fueled that motion?

Most directly, of course, there&rsquo;s the trivial answer: it&rsquo;s an amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sitting in the relevant muscle cells, a molecule which releases energy as it breaks apart into diphosphate (ADP) and monophosphate (AMP).  This released energy results in muscle contraction.

None of our cells have that much ATP on hand at a time, but &ldquo;other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day&rdquo; ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate)).

Where does the energy come from, that&rsquo;s injected into the ADP and AMP to build new ATP?  In your fasted state, the fuel is almost exclusively the molecules called free fatty acids (FFA): lipids in the bloodstream.  Where did it come from?  It was released from adipose cells (&ldquo;fat cells&rdquo;).  Which adipose cells?  All of them at the same time!

This is a point of confusion among novice fitness fanatics, so let&rsquo;s reiterate: all adipose cells release a few of their stored lipid molecules continuously, over time, into the bloodstream.  It is not possible to make specific adipose cells, such as those on your stomach, release more lipids by doing a lot of sit-ups.  You&rsquo;re not getting abs by that mechanism (muscle growth helps define the abs, but the fat covering them stays the same thickness).  It&rsquo;s your total energy expenditure that tells the body how much more FFA is needed in the bloodstream, and all adipose cells are listening to that signal equally.

Moving on:  where did the adipose cells get those lipids?  Well, they came by way of the bloodstream from your digestive system, at some point in the past when it was in the process of breaking down food.

To clarify: the adipose cells were taking FFA out of the blood to fill themselves.  But this is weird: how did they know they should do that, instead of continuously release them as usual?  As you know, the blood circulates around the entire body, and you can&rsquo;t send something from one specific part of the body to another specific part, as if you were sending envelopes with an address.  The blood has no mailman.

The answer is hormones.  Sometimes your adipose cells &#x2013; all of them &#x2013; are under the influence of hormones that tell them to vaccum up lipids from the bloodstream, sometimes they&rsquo;re not and they&rsquo;ll release lipids instead.

Because of that, you can think of all your adipose cells together as one big barrel of oil.

When you eat any kind of meal, that meal&rsquo;s lipids and the lipid-soluble micronutrients, such as vitamins A, D, E & K, get distributed to all your adipose cells.  This is like you were to just add them into that oil barrel and stir with a big spoon.  Later when they release lipids into the blood again, out comes a mixed lipid profile of all the meals you&rsquo;ve ever eaten&#x2026;

(This is why you can stay indoors a cloudy day and still not have zero vitamin D in the blood.)

What about if you eat a low- or no-fat diet?  Then you might think the adipose cells never fill up, right?  But in that case, they take glucose out of the bloodstream and do *de novo lipogenesis*: turn them into fat.  So it makes no difference; in that regard, eating 1000 calories in carbohydrate form still results in adding 1000 calories of fat to your adipose cells.  That&rsquo;s one reason it makes very little sense to focus on low-fat diets for the purposes of weight loss.

I think it&rsquo;s important to observe the fact we&rsquo;ll make fat anyway, while it&rsquo;s only basic biochemistry, because it pulls the rug out from underneath the idea that a low-fat diet will &ldquo;prevent clogging the arteries&rdquo;.  You can&rsquo;t *not* constantly be having fat in the bloodstream, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re eating.


<a id="org0b7cae5"></a>

### Part Deux: LCHF

OK, part one assumed you hadn&rsquo;t eaten for a week.  It makes for a very simple analysis.

Now let&rsquo;s assume you quit fasting and eat a high-fat, no-carb meal.  What changes?

In principle, nothing.  The digestive system will be injecting lipids into the bloodstream, and the adipose cells absorb the excess.  Hormonally, not much happens compared to a fasted state.


<a id="orgb08f21d"></a>

### TODO Part Tres: High carb

Now assume you eat a high-carb meal.

Lots of things happen.

To start off, the carbohydrates break down into the component monosaccharides: glucose, fructose and galactose.

-   **Fructose** will be picked up by the liver for storage as liver glycogen, and when that store is full, the liver uses the fructose for *de novo lipogenesis*.  There&rsquo;s something like a limit at 50 g/day that it can handle.  (Q: What happens when exceeded?)
-   **Galactose** is rapidly converted to glucose, because it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous.  All animals do this conversion, however if you feed galactose to mice for a long time, it seems nevertheless to accelerate their aging.
-   **Glucose** just goes straight into the bloodstream.  Here&rsquo;s where hormones come into the picture.

The body seems to allow a certain range of blood glucose, 4-6 mmol/l, and the more it rises past that, the more body will do to bring it back down.  As it happens, there are only three things it can do:

1.  Use it to immediately make ATP (in layman&rsquo;s terms, burn it) for an action that&rsquo;s happening right now, such as moving your arm.
2.  Store it as glycogen.
3.  Do *de novo lipogenesis*, and store it as fat.

Step \\#1 sounds great, but there&rsquo;s only so much glucose you can remove this way.  A meal may have 1000 calories, and you burn about 100 calories per hour being alive and if you do cardio exercise and sweat your ass off for an hour, maybe that&rsquo;s another 200, but that leaves 700 that still has to proceed to steps \\#2 and \\#3 this hour.  Since nobody does an hour of cardio after every single meal, most of the time that figure is 900.

Keep in mind that on a high-carb diet, your muscle glycogen stores are always full, so there&rsquo;s only liver glycogen to re-fill and then proceed to step \\#3.  In this thought experiment, you had just been fasting for some time, so it&rsquo;s likely the muscle glycogen stores also have free space.

TODO: does glucose go to the liver at all or it has to be fructose?

The sum of all muscle glycogen, when full,

(In practice, step \\#3 must be what happens for most of the food you eat.  It&rsquo;s stored and then released continuously over time.)

(You do not want a very high level of blood glucose, as it would kill you.  So after a high-carbohydrate meal, the blood glucose is rising, rising, and rising.)

## TODO What makes an amino acid essential?

Researchers so far have classified 18(?) amino acids as essential to humans, because we don&rsquo;t make any or don&rsquo;t make enough of them within the body.

But achieving sufficiency is not as simple as exceeding a fixed minimum of each.  The minimum of a given amino acid will *move* up or down, depending on the other amino acids you have consumed.

When RDAs were born in 1941(?), the intent was to reduce malnutrition symptoms among the populace.  But that doesn&rsquo;t say whether an amount is ideal, only that it&rsquo;s good.

Also it&rsquo;s interesting&#x2026; some of it&rsquo;s based on animal studies where the goal is finding out *what makes the animal grow fastest* &#x2013; if I remember, the RDA for the amino acid methionine is based on this.

I feel someone should figure out a way to approach the issue of partial deficiency.  It&rsquo;s not detected, but still causes disease.  Much like an ache can be caused by problems with fascia far from the site of pain &#x2013; as fascial slings go around the body, wrapping it like a package &#x2013; a partial deficiency of some nutrient can cause hard-to-diagnose problems because nutrients are always interacting with each other and we only know the telltale signs of an absolute deficiency.

## TODO What does it mean to &ldquo;need&rdquo; a nutrient?

As someone said, &ldquo;need&rdquo; is a funny concept.  You don&rsquo;t need to eat seafood.  You don&rsquo;t need an appendix or legs, either.  Maybe we can call it a shorthand for that **it&rsquo;ll lengthen our healthspan** (which is not just lifespan, but taking into account &ldquo;healthy life years&rdquo;).

## TODO What if the food volume hypothesis is wrong?

This line of thought took a long time to wrap my head around, but it blew my mind well.

So much of reasoning around nutrition, particularly for weight gain and weight loss, relies on background assumptions that no one identifies directly.  I&rsquo;m thinking of:

-   The stomach physically full must mean body will feel satisfied
-   Since fat is calorie-dense, you&rsquo;ll eat more calories before the stomach fills up, and therefore you will get fatter if you eat fat instead of carbs or fiber

Consequences if it&rsquo;s wrong:

-   calorie density does not matter
-   total calorie amount in a meal does not matter
-   salads do not matter

What&rsquo;s left to watch for then?  How *do* you lose weight if low-calorie meals are an ineffectual wild goose chase?

Hormones.  It&rsquo;s only ever about hormones.

## Vitamin C

Sailors used to get scurvy (a disease of vitamin C deficiency), because they brought no fruit on the long voyages.  They brought only dried bread and meats.

After vitamin C was discovered in the beginning of the 1900s, we cured scurvy and everyone accepted the primacy of fruit (or sauerkraut).  Around the same time, though it&rsquo;s been forgotten, the arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson wrote back to civlization about the local Inuit people, who could survive off an all-animal diet for nine months at a time without any signs of scurvy, and in fact were in excellent health.  Stefansson wasn&rsquo;t perfect ([One Thousand Nails in the Coffin of Vilhjálmur Stefansson](https://www.freetheanimal.com/2014/04/explorer-vilhjalmur-stefansson.html)), but he and another person underwent an experiment at Bellevue Hospital of eating only meat, and they were fine.  I assume it was just too hard to reconcile these observations with the background of the new vitamin C wisdom, so we shrugged and forgot about him.

(Even if Stefansson was a total fraud, this is a case where you should expect to find many corroborating anecdotes and few contraindicating ones (even with self-selection bias, some contraindications should show up on some sites) &#x2013; and that&rsquo;s true.  To date, I&rsquo;ve not read a single zero-carber on the internet reporting scurvy, and some have been zero-carb for decades.)

The Inuit ate meat, but not bread.  Following via negativa, is it possible that the sailors got scurvy not because they left out fruit, but because they continued to include *bread*?

Two hopefully uncontroversial facts of biochemistry support this (though I may have been misled):

-   The body can recycle vitamin C endlessly.  To deplete it, something else you&rsquo;re doing has to deplete it.
-   Carbohydrates cause oxidative stress, which the body counterbalances by expending antioxidants&#x2026; such as vitamin C.

If the reasoning is valid, then it appears we can conclude that dietary vitamin C isn&rsquo;t necessary during fasting or on a zero-carbohydrate diet, but *when* you start eating bread (grain is the only carbohydrate-rich food without vitamin C), *then* you also have to eat fruit or vegetables to stave off scurvy.  Bread causes scurvy!

Another conclusion is that vitamin C may not be an essential nutrient, but what&rsquo;s called *conditionally essential* &#x2013; i.e. it depends on what else you eat &#x2013; and only mistaken for essential because of the universality of grain in the Western diet.


<a id="orgbaebba7"></a>

## Vitamin K2

A rare vitamin, found mainly in **fat** from grass-fed or wild animals, or aged cheese.  Not to be confused with Vitamin K1 which can be found in dark green vegetables (like spinach) among other things.


<a id="orge5e0120"></a>

## Vitamin B12

About 40% of people have low-normal &ldquo;serum B12&rdquo; (vitamin B12 in the blood).  Understand that serum B12 is one of the last markers to fall out of normal range, so if it is beginning to drop from normal, you&rsquo;re almost definitely deficient.

This vitamin is a common supplement for vegans because it is *only* found in animals, though there is some in tempeh.

Interesting because you can even observe many omnivores being deficient, giving us a guideline to how much meat is enough.


<a id="org450c7ab"></a>

## Vitamin A


<a id="org34e1fc2"></a>

## Creatine

People commonly see creatine as a bodybuilder thing &#x2013; why would normal people need creatine?  Actually, bodybuilders may need it the least &#x2013; they&rsquo;re used to challenging their muscles to the maximum as it is, and I believe this will produce the full MPS reaction (muscle protein synthesis).  For people who don&rsquo;t exercise much, this could mean an extra kick whenever they do lift something, and more energy to make the decision *to lift it* in the first place.  That&rsquo;s just a supposition, but it opens my mind to creatine as a nutrient for normal people.  Forget its association to the gym and analyze it like any other nutrient.

Creatine is a naturally occurring substance &#x2013; about half of your creatine is produced inside your body, the other half is provided from meat, eggs and fish.

What it does is sit in your muscle, just like glycogen, ready to provide energy.  It&rsquo;s a straightforward job.  A difference from glycogen in strenuous exercise is that creatine gets used up almost immediately and recharges in time for the next set of exercise &#x2013; and for a given set, a tiny portion of the energy comes from creatine.  That may be because strenuous exercise is strenuous, it uses lots of energy all at once.  Perhaps for less strenuous exercise, such as walking, a greater fraction will come from creatine?

From various Internet anecdotes, people who eat animals often feel no effect taking additional creatine, but vegans experience a significant difference: everything from moving to thinking becomes easier, apparently clearing away &ldquo;brain fog&rdquo;.

A point on safety.  There are various forms of creatine, and the form called **creatine monohydrate** has undergone extensive study, looking very safe in the prescribed quantities (5g/day), unless you have kidney problems.  Can we extrapolate that if you were a heavy meat-eater you would also experience problems if your kidneys are not working right?

## Forms of omega-3

There are different forms of omega-3.  The plant-based version is Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA), which you can find in e.g. rapeseed oil and linseed oil.  Less than 1% of it (depends on genes?) is converted inside the body to the forms it uses: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

Omega-3 in the true EPA/DHA form is mainly found in seafood, such as oily fish, and in brains (our brain is 15% DHA by weight, and brain health is intimately linked to DHA intake).  To a small extent it is also found in fat from grass-fed animals, oysters, and some seaweeds.


<a id="orga39fe0c"></a>

## Effects of omega-3

Deficiency leads to dry skin, poor eyesight, and neurodegeneration.


<a id="org8663a26"></a>

## Omega 3-6 balance

People talk about a balance of omega 3 to omega 6, that it should be about 1:1, maybe 1:4 at worst.

In the West, people average eating a ratio around 1:20.  I don&rsquo;t know where this number is from but I worry that most of the &ldquo;1&rdquo; there is also ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid) from seed oils, which the body does not really use, so it&rsquo;s even worse than it sounds.

There have been signs that actually *the balance doesn&rsquo;t matter* so long as you are getting a certain a minimum of omega-3.


<a id="org3118bc1"></a>

## sn-2 DHA

The body converts between EPA and DHA interchangeably, but DHA is ultimately the main form that goes into cellular tissue.  The brain is 25% (?) DHA by weight.  So we sometimes just talk about DHA, since this is the important thing.  I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s smart but it&rsquo;s convenient to talk about it as a shorthand for both EPA/DHA, i.e. &ldquo;the subject ate 2g of DHA&rdquo; they actually ate a mix of EPA/DHA. Welp.

The molecule DHA comes in multiple forms, sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3.  Apparently the body uses sn-2 best.

There is more sn-2 in seafood than in fish oil capsules. (How? Does the refinement change the molecule??) <http://caloriesproper.com/vegetable-oil-fatty-acids-are-not-essential/>


<a id="org71b4469"></a>

## Genetic need of omega-3

There&rsquo;s indication that Inuit peoples and a portion of the Nordic population have genes such that they need a huge amount of omega-3.  How huge?  I don&rsquo;t know, but for perspective, we know the amounts some traditional Inuit groups ate: 14-20 g/day. This corresponds to 400-600 g of herring/mackerel daily.

Now that&rsquo;s probably overshooting their minimum need, but if we say it&rsquo;s half of the low end, that&rsquo;s still at least 200 g of herring daily, or 1.4 kg weekly.


<a id="org0cab385"></a>

## How much seafood?

If you have extra [genetic need of omega-3](#org71b4469), the problem is that you cannot practically consume these amounts via fish oil capsules.  One gram of omega-3 would be three 1-g capsules of non-concentrated fish oil, so to get 7g of o3, we&rsquo;re looking at swallowing 21 capsules, or 42 half-gram capsules, in one day.  Every day, 365 days a year&#x2026; 15,330 capsules a year.  This many capsules is not recommended, they may contain byproducts that give you adverse effects.  To compound the matter, omega-3 is not as well absorbed in this form than when it comes as part of seafood&#x2026; so this absurd amount may still be too few.

There&rsquo;s also the monetary aspect.  Fish oil is more expensive after processing than when it was still on the fish in question.  To frame it differently, if you eat fish just for the omega-3, you&rsquo;re not only paying less for the omega-3, but you get the protein and other nutrients of a full meal without paying anything.

---

A different pointer at the correct quantity comes from the research on telomeres, which connects high &ldquo;omega-3 index&rdquo; with less telomere shortening.  If you don&rsquo;t know about telomeres, in summary they&rsquo;re parts of each cell&rsquo;s DNA core that shortens over time.  Once they&rsquo;re too short, they can no longer divide.  Long telomeres mean long life.

You can get your &ldquo;omega 3 index&rdquo; tested: it tells you what percentage of the fatty acids in your blood is omega-3.  People in the USA/EU average 4%.  It should be sitting at >8%, and probably be as high as possible (not heard of any negative effect).  To achieve >8%, you typically need more than two &ldquo;servings&rdquo; of seafood per week, whatever &ldquo;serving&rdquo; means.  Source of this reasoning: <https://web.archive.org/web/20170620091732/http://caloriesproper.com/omega-3-index/>

It&rsquo;s likely that people report &ldquo;serving&rdquo; very differently, and many people eat lean fish and call it seafood.  So if you make sure to choose wild oily fish, I wager that two normal-size servings per week, whatever that means for you, will suffice.


<a id="orgae29db2"></a>

## Leucine

You need ~3g of leucine to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). See <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558471>. So any one meal needs to exceed a certain amount of protein.

This utilizes the mTOR pathway, which you ought to counterbalance by fasting.

HOW MUCH LEUCINE IS IN 100g OF FOOD? From nutritiondata.self.com:

    cheese, cheddar           2385 mg
    cheese, gouda             2564 mg
    egg, whole, raw           1088 mg
    fish, herring, raw        1460 mg
    yogurt, plain, whole milk  350 mg
    beef, brisket, raw (1)    1395 mg
    beef, brisket, raw (2)    1637 mg
    chicken, raw              1245 mg

So 1.2 to 1.7 grams of leucine in 100 g of meat. So 250 g of meat is minimum at one meal, 300 g a better minimum to be on the safe side.

## CLA

Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a fat found mainly in grass-fed ruminant fat, and to a small extent in champignons (button mushrooms).

Interesting because it&rsquo;s an example of a natural trans fat, as opposed to an artificial trans fat.  It&rsquo;s great for health, but I forgot why.


<a id="org78623b9"></a>

## Leaking nutrients

All B vitamins are water-soluble, not fat-soluble.  Personal supposition: they could leak out of food when cooked.  So we could expect things like ham or dried food to have much less B vitamins.  I have no idea if this is true.

If true, electrolytes (natrium, kalium, magnesium, iodine) could also leak out on the same principle.

I wager that fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) also leak out, when fat leaks out.  When frying fish, scoop up that valuable fish oil.   (And protect them from oxidation by having saturated fats in the pan, along with antioxidants such as rosemary.)


<a id="org214d6f9"></a>

## Iodine

Iodine comes from the sea, and may be in [coastal soil](http://www.wheatbellyblog.com/2012/07/an-iodine-primer/), and thereby animals and plants living on coasts.  It&rsquo;s not unusual for animals living far inland to run into iodine deficiency.  Among humans today it is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability, and though much of the world now uses iodized table salt we are running on a bare minimum of iodine intake, a dangerous line to balance on.

Iodine is found in seafood and seaweeds.  Kelp is a cost-effective food, with astronomical amounts of iodine &#x2013; 1 ml of granulated kelp will give you more iodine than most people get in a day.  You can add it to your salt shaker for convenience.  Unfortunately, it may have [high amounts of bromide](https://iodinehealth.wordpress.com/iodine-types/) which cancels out the iodine.  More research needed.

There are several reasons we deplete the iodine in our bodies &#x2013; chiefly, other halogens, see the bromide in pesticides, baked goods, soft drinks and vegetable oils, the fluoride and chlorine in municipal water, etc.  You need a lot of iodine to reverse the problem.

Table salts tend to have iodine added.  However, there are multiple naturally-occurring forms of iodine, and at least two necessary forms (iodide and elemental iodine), and table salt only has one, and it evaporates within three weeks of opening the box.  The amount of iodine you&rsquo;ll ever get from table salt also is low.

If you want to maximize the iodine from table salt, buy new packages often, preferably resealable.  If you live alone, buy small packages.  That said, you&rsquo;re still only getting iodide, not elemental iodine.

Other than kelp and table salt, sources of iodine are: plants grown on **iodine-rich soil**, animals grown on aforementioned plants (should be in the blood like other electrolytes, but it&rsquo;s also been known to be in dairy and eggs; how much is collected in the meat, fat, bones or organs, I don&rsquo;t know), seaweeds, fish, shellfish.

Due to the potential difficulty or cost in making sure your diet has enough iodine, it may be smart to start taking a supplement for the time being.

On a very-low carbohydrate diet, some voice concerns about reduced thyroid function &#x2013; but it appears this can be remedied by elevating iodine intake, something you should be doing anyway, instead of elevating carbohydrate intake.  To recap: with less carbs, adding iodine becomes even more important.

One problem with iodine is that a sudden change in intake can have negative effects &#x2013; you should build up your intake gradually.  Perhaps the level of iodine in the soil where our ancestors lived determined the level in the animals and plants we ate, and thereby the level in our bodies.  Since soil would also have determined the level of magnesium and many other substances inside us, it is interesting to ask from which soil we should get food.


<a id="org9dccef0"></a>

## Soil

The soil is where many nutrients come from &#x2013; plants grow in it, cattle eats those plants, and you eat those cattle.  It is known that the soil has a large effect on the nutritional value of a plant.  Things to test in the soil at your local farm include iodine, magnesium, radioactive isotopes, and heavy metals.  As a rule, if that plot of land has been overfarmed or heavily farmed in the past, it is going to be &ldquo;drained&rdquo; of nutrients.  Prefer land that has been sustainably farmed or not farmed at all.  Consult maps of where isotopes have landed from nuclear disasters and atomic weapons testing &#x2013; large swathes of your country may be unsuitable (something that is not spoken publicly because feeding the world is hard enough already).

The skeletons of humans from before agriculture had perfect teeth and space enough in the mouth for every tooth.  Agriculture saw the arrival of a multitude of minor birth deformities, like the crowded teeth many of us have, and people got shorter statures and lived shorter lives. Only with modern medicine have we caught up to the lifespans naturally achieved by our ancestors.

## Gut bacteria

Very strange: there have been signs that a varied diet is *worse* than a one-sided diet at building gut biodiversity! <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140528105252.htm>

Should we be consistent with our diet, for a consistent flora? 

Or perhaps we should do different specialized diets in sequence, to give different cultures a chance to shine and outcompete the others?  But that might cause an unending sequence of Herxheimer-like reactions (where you feel ill health because your previous gut flora is dying off).

To pattern lifestyle after the Paleolithic, it&rsquo;s likely that they would have eaten different foods at different times of year.  Stretching out your variation over a year would give you fewer problems with sudden dieoff.  Above all, it seems, to keep diversity high, avoid supporting generalist species.  That would mean different one-sided diets at different times, and no fruit in the winter.

But is diversity important?  Poor gut biodiversity, such as after a round of antibiotics, has been linked to diseases like SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overflow).

## Pesticide

[Pesticides](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/why-i-dont-trust-the-acceptable-daily-intake-levels-for-pesticides/)

See the Roundup pesticide, still in use today

When they test whether a pesticide is harmful, they test it on human cells (called *in vitro* testing) &#x2013; they neglect to test the *other* part of the human animal: the bacteria in your gut, which are required for health, many species of which demonstrate severe weakness to pesticides &#x2013; after all, they&rsquo;re roughly what pesticides are designed to kill.

Organic foods aren&rsquo;t pesticide-free &#x2013; they just use other kinds of pesticides, that are perhaps less effective but more of them are used.  I heard about one farmer kid saying, &ldquo;I love organic &#x2013; I get to spray it twice as much&rdquo;.

While organic isn&rsquo;t pesticide-free, it tends to be safer(?) to eat.

There is one way to avoid pesticides &#x2013; and that is to grow food that doesn&rsquo;t need pesticide: animals.  Of course, that supposes they&rsquo;re not fed farmed food, just grass.


<a id="orge6c2abd"></a>

## GMO

The majority (70%+) of genetically modified organisms are modified with pesticide components.  No way to wash off those residues &#x2013; they&rsquo;re in the food.  Concerns that apply to pesticides therefore apply to GMO as well.  Other strategies involve making the food *resistant* to a pesticide, so that it will not be harmed, and the farmers then spray massive amounts (since the food survives).  It may be very important for us to wash that food with soap, or just peel and toss its outermost layers.


<a id="orgeccb82a"></a>

## Difference between grass-fed and grain-fed

In liver, the grass-fed variety has eight times as much vitamin A.  I&rsquo;m not kidding, **eight!**

Maybe it was a fluke because the amount depends on which animal the FDA/USDA/(who?) tested, but it seems unlikely.  If it&rsquo;s a common pattern for vitamin A, what does it say about other nutrients?

## Methionine-glycine balance

Your food doesn&rsquo;t just determine your health, it determines the very thoughts you think and the emotions that well up in your chest!  Chris Masterjohn&rsquo;s essay  [Meat, Organs, Bones and Skin](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/meat-organs-bones-and-skin/) highlights a process called methylation which is regulated by the proportions of methionine and glycine in your diet &#x2013; that is, how much muscle meat you eat compared to skin, cartilage and bone broth.  Let me quote a piece:

> Two analogies should prove useful to help us understand the need to balance mental stability with mental flexibility. In the first, we could imagine a potter who makes clay flexible by moistening it before attempting to make something out of it.  Too little moisture will lead to brittle clay: it is too dry to shape into anything, and applying enough force to change its shape will simply make it break, exposing rough and sharp edges.  Too much moisture will make it easy to manipulate, but no shape given to it will hold.  The right amount of moisture will make the clay malleable enough to manipulate into something useful or beautiful, and yet stable enough to retain the shape given it.
> 
> Similarly, not enough methylation could lead to “brittle” mental states.  Such states are difficult to change, but when they do change, the transitions are sudden and without warning.  This brittleness could lead to dangerous situations.  For example, ordinarily when we get angry, the process is gradual enough that we may realize what is happening to us and stop ourselves from acting out in our anger, or someone else may notice that we are becoming angry and intervene to diffuse the situation.  If our mental states are too brittle, however, we may act violently without warning, giving neither ourselves nor those around us any opportunity to recognize what is happening and intervene.  Alternatively, too much methylation could make our minds like a bowl of liquid clay: easy to make a mess with, but difficult to shape into something beautiful or useful.
> 
> In the second analogy, we could consider our consciousness like a net through which thousands of thoughts fly every day.  These thoughts could be about basic biological drives and needs like food, sex, and sleep; they could be about the multitude of things we need to get done; or they could be thoughts that motivate us, whether to do good things or to do things that would get us into trouble.  To achieve mental health, our net of consciousness needs enough flexibility that we are able to manipulate it as each thought approaches, choosing either to let it pass through or to hold on to it.  This net also needs enough stability, however, to hold onto beneficial thoughts for as long as they are needed.  Without flexibility, we hold onto everything that comes our way indiscriminately.  Without stability, we cannot hold onto anything at all.  With a proper balance, we become masters of our thoughts rather than their captives.

In particular, this is fascinating &#x2013; emphasis mine:

> Vegetarians excrete almost twice the level of a unique marker of glycine deficiency in their urine as omnivores.<sup>17</sup>  This suggests that excluding animal products from the diet could not only lead to a generally inadequate level of methylation because of lower intakes of methionine and vitamin B12, but the lower intake of glycine could also lead to transient periods of excessive methylation. This could theoretically result in **seesawing between excessive mental stability and excessive mental flexibility**.
> 
> The purpose of this article, however, is not to denigrate vegetarian diets but to emphasize the importance of nutrient-dense animal foods.  A standard omnivorous diet is hardly the ideal.  Even omnivores excrete substantial amounts of the marker of glycine deficiency discussed above in their urine.  This could be because the typical omnivore fails to make use of skin and bones in their diet.

## Meat toxins

[Meat Toxins: What they are, why they exist, how to avoid them](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/12/meat-toxins-what-they-are-why-they-exist-how-to-avoid-them/)

In short, meat doesn&rsquo;t have toxins, unless you do things to it like

-   curing it with nitrite
-   smoking it in a barbecue
-   overcooking it
-   deep-frying it in seed oils
-   cooking it with margarines or hydrogenated oils
-   cooking it together with sugar
-   eating it together with sugar

When reading research studies about meat, always check how they prepare it.

Sometimes people mention meat containing Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), linked to aging.  This fear is unfounded since even if you burn the meat, the amount is small compared to the AGEs produced in the body just from *burning carbohydrates as fuel* (let that sink in).

One valid concern is Heterocyclic Amines, which form at high temperatures.  There&rsquo;s more of these the hotter the meat gets, so gentle cooking methods such as stewing and steaming are better.  Similar rules apply to cooking plants, meat isn&rsquo;t special in this regard: all foods are damaged by overcooking.

But of course (do we even have to say it?):

-   never barbecue
-   never use sugar marinades
-   never blacken the meat


<a id="org1b08628"></a>

## Choline

I&rsquo;ve spent time on forums about human longevity, and one of the first things they like to supplement is choline.  In addition, it&rsquo;s popular in the nootropics community, who think it may help your smarts.

There are many forms of choline, like phosphatidylcholine and blah blah blah&#x2026; and it&rsquo;s present in all animal tissue, but what&rsquo;s interesting: **your body will expend the choline in order to &ldquo;neutralize&rdquo; methionine.**  As you know, the amino acid methionine is found in large quantities in muscle meat (and eggs).  Which means that, if you eat muscle meat but not other parts of the animal, you may still fail to get enough choline.

You shouldn&rsquo;t be wasting choline on this &#x2013; eat glycine-rich foods, see [Methionine-glycine balance](#orgaed8fd2).

What&rsquo;s a good source of choline?  Liver!  It stands alone as an effective choline source.

For plant sources, the betaine found mostly in spinach (and to a small extent in beetroots, after which it&rsquo;s named), can be converted in the body to choline but not a lot.  This makes spinach essential for vegans.

Genetics can help.  90% of Japanese people have a gene for converting some methionine to choline ([source](http://blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/2010/12/meeting-choline-requirement-eggs-organs.html)), but not so many Western people have it.


<a id="orgd94eb62"></a>

## Gelatin, glycine, GAGs

Collagen is a type of protein that dominates in bone joints, skin and other &ldquo;chewy&rdquo; parts of an animal.  Dogs and wolves spend a long time chewing bones in order to get this.  If we heat collagen, it turns into a different protein we call gelatin.

The collagen is what makes the chewy parts chewy, and contains the amino acids *glycine* and *proline*, which are uncommon in other foods &#x2013; the chewy parts are our primary dietary source of these amino acids.

Is it important to eat these bits?

Well, I&rsquo;ll just observe that it&rsquo;s common to prescribe something called glucosamine to people with arthritis, because it helps with joint health.  And it turns out glucosamine is a member of a category of nutrients, glucosaminoglycans (GAGs), and it works better to supplement all of these.  And it turns out that Nature&rsquo;s only source of the full spectrum of GAGs, is also the same place we find glycine.  The chewy bits.  The gelatinous bone broth.

Apparently it&rsquo;s known that glycine, proline and GAGs are building blocks for our joints.  How come no one told me this in nutrition class?  I don&rsquo;t want arthritis.

The body can produce some amounts of glycine of its own, expending folate to do so, so vegans would be wise to eat a lot of beans for the folate.

-   Which vitamins have limits and what are the numbers for how the other nutrients affect the limit?
    -   Vitamins A and D take each other out &#x2013; but does this translate to a practical prescription of how much sun you should get for how much liver to eat, or something?  4 hours for every 100 grams?  I&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone talk about that.

# What are we talking about in the first place?

Nutrition science can be a hot potato, as people may approach it from any of several lenses:

1.  Personal weight management
2.  Athletic performance
3.  Diet&rsquo;s effect on a human&rsquo;s health and longevity
4.  Ethical/moral/political issues, such as:
    1.  Global warming
    2.  Other environmental issues, such as biodiversity losses & soil erosion
    3.  Animal suffering; especially talking about CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations), but also life quality for non-CAFO animals
    4.  Animal killing: how many animals killed and how old they&rsquo;re allowed to get

In this page, I talk **only about \\#3**.  While obesity can be a symptom of an unhealthy diet, I&rsquo;m not looking for &ldquo;the secret to weight loss&rdquo;, so \\#1 is no focus.  Similarly for \\#2, athletic performance long-term can be evidence that the diet is good, but again it&rsquo;s not my focus.

I find \\#4 interesting, but we need to keep our eyes on the ball.  To make a good political decision for my way of life, I feel I need to first analyze \\#3 in isolation, because the question of **what foods make people healthy** will impact part of the question of **which society-wide food practices do the most good**, so that I can then campaign for these.

Of course \\#3 can be analyzed forever, but we can stop analyzing at a prespecified stopping condition.  For me it&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ve picked the low-hanging fruit with regards to answerable questions that do have answers today &#x2013; basically try to map how everything fits together, identify my confusions, put them in the Questions section, and try to answer them, spending up to approx. 10 hours per question&#x2026;


<a id="org8d6dd88"></a>

## Questions I want answered before I make a political/ethical decision

-   How much land area is used for pasture, that could have been used for agriculture?
-   How much good farmland is reserved to feed animals?  (How much of that goes to CAFO?)
-   How many humans can we feed in theory, if we only use sustainable farming practices, assign all good farmland to producing human food, and only keep as many animals as can live off pasturing on subpar farmland?
    -   How is this picture affected by the choice of crop?
    -   How is this picture affected by pesticides and GMOs?
    -   How is this picture affected if we have people going out to milk the pasturing cattle vs. don&rsquo;t?
    -   How is this picture affected by the lifespans we allow the cattle?
    -   How is this picture affected by the choice of animal (cow, goat, chicken&#x2026;)?
    -   Crazy thought experiment: following the idea of killing the smallest count of animals for the biggest loads of meat, suppose we only get our meat from blue whales?
-   Is rewilding good from an animal-suffering perspective?  If not, what are our options for minimzing total animal suffering?

    -   Many Paleo-aligned thinkers think there&rsquo;s a huge difference between different plant-based oils, and if they&rsquo;re right, then when you design a study with the presupposition in mind that all plant-based oils are roughly equal, you end up overgeneralizing.  If you must classify, clarify whether you&rsquo;re talking about seed oil (rapeseed, sunflower, safflower, linseed, &#x2026;), nut oil (macadamia), or fruit oil (olive, avocado).  In the case of &ldquo;palm oil&rdquo;, differentiate between palm fruit oil (obviously a fruit oil) and palm kernel oil (a seed oil).
